Everyone knows how to ask an AI about the weather. But the real magic happens when you use advanced techniques and tools, most of which are free.

### 1. Local Models: Full Control with Ollama
Why depend on someone else's servers when you can run a powerful language model right on your own computer?
*   **Tool:** [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)
*   **What it is:** The easiest way to download and run models (Llama 3, Mistral) with a single command.
*   **How to use:** Install Ollama, then run `ollama run llama3` in your terminal. That's it! You have your own, completely private chatbot.

### 2. Prompt Engineering: The "Chain of Thought" Technique
To get a high-quality answer to a complex question, make the model "think out loud." Just add the phrase: `"Let's think step by step"` at the end of your prompt. This dramatically improves accuracy on tasks that require logic.

### 3. AI Search Engines: Answers Instead of Links
AI search engines don't just give you links; they analyze information and provide a ready, structured answer with sources.
*   **Tool:** [Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/)
*   **How to use:** Instead of Googling "best practices REST API python," ask Perplexity: "What are the best practices for creating a REST API in Python with code examples?". You'll get a complete article, not just a list of links.
